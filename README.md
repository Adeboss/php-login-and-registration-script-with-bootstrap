# PHP & Bootstrap User authentication system with basic social media features

Welcome 

This project is a side project which i will be working on slowly.  At present i am currently looking at transfering all of the files to a new repo as the project is now starting to progress past just being a user authentication system.  

This system could be used for a number of different applications and easily integrated into any projects you may be thinking of creating.  

I have used PHP PDO, JS, HTML, CSS to create this system.  The basic functions are to: 
	Create a user (Register)
	Login a user 
	Reset a users password 
	Show a basic profile of the logged in user.   

 
I have included the SQL DB i currently have for this project.  There is one user currently registered, however you can easily create a new user to register.  When i have finished creating the system as far as the scope of this project goes.  I will upload a new SQL DB with no registered users. 

If you want to integrate this system into any of your projects please feel free to do so.  If you want to make any changes to the project files then please feel free to do so.  
 

***** This project will soon stop being updated.  This is due to the scope of the project changing from a user authentication system.
