# php-login-and-registration-script-with-bootstrap

Welcome to my user authentication system 

This user authenication system uses PHP PDO to: Register a user, Log a user in, basic forgotten password function.  

This project could be used in a number of different situations.  If you were to use this project on a web based (not local machine) porject i would suggest using a better hashing method than i have here (I have used PHPS standard build in function).

Please feel free to use this if you wish to or even make some changes to it where you think it could do with improvements.  

***** This project will shortly stop being updated as i will be moving it to a new repo due to the scope of things changing.  When i have moved projects i will post a link to the new project here.
